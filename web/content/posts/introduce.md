# Introduce about yourself

I graduated with a major in software engineering from the Military Technical Academy in 2021. I have been working for about 6 years, during which the first 2 years I worked for an outsourcing company mainly dealing with JavaScript. After that, I switched to a product company in the e-commerce field where I started working with Golang and AWS cloud services. The next company I worked for was a crypto exchange platform called Attlas. Being a startup, I was involved in building the core components from scratch. Currently,I have worked for VPBank. The main product that I joined is a loyalty system. It mainly uses Golang to build backend and chaincode for a private blockchain network and a combination of aws and on premise for infrastructure.
