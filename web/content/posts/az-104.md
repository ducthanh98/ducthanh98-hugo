# Entra ID
## Managed Identity
- System-assigned: some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Microsoft Entra ID that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
– User-assigned: you may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. In the case of user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.
## Self service reset password
- Only global admin can add security questions for password reset.
# Subscription and Management group
- A management group can contain many subscription
- Core components:
    + Access control: 
    + Policy:
    + Budget: 
- For each resource group we can create its own iam, policy,buget
- Maximum 50 tags and it isn't inherited
# Roles
- Owner: perform any action, change permissions on it for whatever scope it's set at
- Contributor: do all things except change permissions
- Reader: read everything
- Operator role only lets you read, enable, and disable apps.

# Azure Network Watcher 
- provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network. Network Watcher is designed to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) products which includes Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Application Gateways, Load balancers, etc.
## Network security group (NSG) flow logs are: 
- a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port, protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG. Flow data is sent to Azure Storage accounts from where you can access it as well as export it to any visualization tool, SIEM, or IDS of your choice.
## IP flow 
- verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the Internet and from or to the on-premises environment.
## Next hop 
-  determine if traffic is being directed to the intended destination, or whether the traffic is being sent nowhere
# Backup
## Azure Backup 
- a cost-effective, secure, one-click backup solution that’s scalable based on your backup storage needs. The centralized management interface makes it easy to define backup policies and protect a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, SQL and SAP databases, and Azure file shares.
- When you back up data in Azure, you store that data in an Azure resource called a Recovery Services vault. The Recovery Services vault resource is available from the Settings menu of most Azure services. The benefit of having the Recovery Services vault integrated into the Settings menu of most Azure services is the ease of backing up data.
- Here are the steps when you backup an Azure virtual machine:
+ Create a Recovery Services vault
+ Define a backup policy
+ Apply the backup policy to protect multiple virtual machines
