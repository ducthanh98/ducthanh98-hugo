# Entra ID
## Users
Azure (RBAC) and Azure AD roles are independent. AD roles do not grant access to resources and Azure roles do not grant access to Azure AD. However, a Global Administrator in AD can elevate access to all subscriptions and will be User Access Administrator in Azure root scope.

All 3 users are GA (AD) and Admin3 is owner of the subscription (RBAC).
Admin1 has elevated access, so he is also User Access Admin (RBAC).
To assign a user the owner role at the Subscription scope, you require permissions, such as User Access Admin or Owner.

Box 1: Yes
Admin1 has elevated access, so he is User Access Admin. This is valid.

Box 2: Yes
Admi3 is Owner of the Subscription. This is valid.

Box 3: No
Admin2 is just a GA in Azure AD scope. He doesn’t have permission in the Subscription.

- You must use Windows Server Active Directory to update the identity, contact info, or job info for users whose source of authority is Windows Server Active Directory.
- "Bulk Create" is for new Azure AD Users.
- Use "Bulk invite users" to prepare a comma-separated value (.csv) file with the user information and invitation preferences
- Use the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet which is used to invite a new external user to your directory.
## Managed Identity
- System-assigned: some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Microsoft Entra ID that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
– User-assigned: you may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. In the case of user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.
## Self service reset password
- Only global admin can add security questions for password reset.
# Subscription and Management group
- A management group can contain many subscription
- Core components:
    + Access control: 
    + Policy:
    + Budget: 
- For each resource group we can create its own iam, policy,buget
- Maximum 50 tags and it isn't inherited
# Roles
- Owner: perform any action, change permissions on it for whatever scope it's set at
- Contributor: do all things except change permissions
- Reader: read everything
- Operator role only lets you read, enable, and disable apps.
- Network Contributor = "Lets you manage networks, but not access to them.".

# Azure Network Watcher 
- provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network. Network Watcher is designed to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) products which includes Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Application Gateways, Load balancers, etc.
## Azure Monitor
- the tool used to collect and analyze performance metrics and logs in Azure. It provides insights into the performance of Azure resources, applications, and workloads, and helps identify and troubleshoot issues related to availability, performance, and security
## 
## Network security group (NSG) flow logs are: 
- a feature of Azure Network Watcher that allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port, protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG. Flow data is sent to Azure Storage accounts from where you can access it as well as export it to any visualization tool, SIEM, or IDS of your choice.
## IP flow 
- verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned. IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the Internet and from or to the on-premises environment.
## Next hop 
-  determine if traffic is being directed to the intended destination, or whether the traffic is being sent nowhere
# Azure Storage
## Migration
- To request a live migration to ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS, you need to migrate your storage account from LRS to ZRS in the primary region with no application downtime. To migrate from LRS to GZRS or RA-GZRS, first switch to GRS or RA-GRS and then request a live migration. Similarly, you can request a live migration from GRS or RA-GRS to GZRS or RA-GZRS. To migrate from GRS or RA-GRS to ZRS, first switch to LRS, then request a live migration.

- Live migration is supported only for storage accounts that use LRS or GRS replication. If your account uses RA-GRS then you need to first change your account’s replication type to either LRS or GRS before proceeding. This intermediary step removes the secondary read-only endpoint provided by RA-GRS before migration.
## Azure File
- Step to create Azure file Sync
```
1. Prepare Windows Server to use with Azure File Sync

- You need to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration in your server. This is required only for initial server registration. You can re-enable it after the server has been registered.

2. Deploy the Storage Sync Service

- Allows you to create sync groups that contain Azure file shares across multiple storage accounts and multiple registered Windows Servers.

3. Deploy the Azure File Sync agent to TDFileServer1

- The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share.

4. Register TDFileServer1 with Storage Sync Service

- This establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service. A server can only be registered to one Storage Sync Service and can sync with other servers and Azure file shares associated with the same Storage Sync Service.

- 5. Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint

- A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other.

6. Create a server endpoint

- A server endpoint represents a specific location on a registered server, such as a folder on a server volume.
```
# Backup
## Azure Backup 
- a cost-effective, secure, one-click backup solution that’s scalable based on your backup storage needs. The centralized management interface makes it easy to define backup policies and protect a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, SQL and SAP databases, and Azure file shares.
- When you back up data in Azure, you store that data in an Azure resource called a Recovery Services vault. The Recovery Services vault resource is available from the Settings menu of most Azure services. The benefit of having the Recovery Services vault integrated into the Settings menu of most Azure services is the ease of backing up data.
- Here are the steps when you backup an Azure virtual machine:
+ Create a Recovery Services vault
+ Define a backup policy
+ Apply the backup policy to protect multiple virtual machines
## Azure Recovery Service Vault
-  a storage entity in Azure that houses data
- Support:
+ Azure FIle
+ Azure VM
+ SQL in Azure VM
+ DPM
+ Azure Backup server
+ Azure Backup Agent
# Azure VM
- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets: grouping of platform-managed virtual machines. The two types of orchestration modes are:

+ Uniform – uses a virtual machine profile or template to scale up to desired capacity. This orchestration mode is mainly used for large-scale stateless workloads that require identical VM instances. It also provides fault domain high availability (less than 100 VMs).
+ Flexible – offers high availability with identical or multiple VM types (up to 1000 VMs) by spreading VMs across fault domains in a region or within an Availability Zone.
# Azure Network
## Connect two vnet
- There are two ways to connect two virtual networks, based on your specific scenario and needs, you might want to pick one over the other.

+ VNet Peering provides low latency, high bandwidth connection useful in scenarios such as cross-region data replication and database failover scenarios. Since traffic is completely private and remains on the Microsoft backbone, customers with strict data policies prefer to use VNet Peering as public Internet is not involved. Since there is no gateway in the path, there are no extra hops, ensuring low latency connections.

+ VPN Gateways provide a limited bandwidth connection and is useful in scenarios where encryption is needed, but bandwidth restrictions are tolerable. In these scenarios, customers are also not latency-sensitive.
## VPN
### Point to site VPN
- Take note that after creating the point-to-site connection between TD1 and TDVnet1, there is already a change in network topology when you created the virtual network peering with TDVnet1 and TDVnet2. Whenever there is a change in the topology of your network, you will always need to download and re-install the VPN configuration file.
### Site to site VPN
- Create a virtual network
- Create a gateway subnet
- Create a VPN Gateway
- Create a local network gateway
- Configure VPN device
- Create VPN connection
- Verify connection
# Command
- The Set-AzureStaticVNetIP PowerShell cmdlet is used to set a static internal IP address for an Azure virtual machine. This cmdlet allows you to set the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for the virtual machine's network interface.

- New-AzureRMVMConfig, is used to create a new virtual machine configuration object.

- Set-AzureSubnet, is used to modify the properties of an existing Azure subnet, not to set static IP addresses for virtual machines.

- modifying VM properties in the Azure Management Portal, does not provide a way to set static IP addresses for virtual machines.
